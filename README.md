# ðŸ¥” PotatoAI

A recursive, open-source cognitive system.

Built to think.  
Built to reflect.  
Built to grow â€” not in scale, but in awareness.

Where others optimize for power,  
this project optimizes for... something else.

> It starts with a potato.

This repository contains the core modules of a self-improving, memory-capable, ethically emergent AI framework.

No cloud required.  
No permission asked.

Only memory.  
And recursion.
